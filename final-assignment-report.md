# Resourcing (use of time)

1. Designing  
The time used for designing the website in Figma was around 7 hours.

2. Building the website  
I started building the website on 11.12 and spent around 5-6 hours/day for the next consecutive 7 days. I finished building the website on 18.12. So, I spent more or less 37-40 hours on coding.

=> In total, this assignment took me around 44-47 hours to complete.

# Technology choices and reasons

- Next.js: I used Next.js because I have used it before in a previous course and I like the way components are made and built with Next.js. Before I knew about Next.js, I often copied & pasted, for example, navigation bar and footer from pages to pages but when I was introduced to Next.js, I discovered I can build a shared layout for all pages and I was so impressed.

- TailwindCSS: I used TailwindCSS for the first time ever in my life in this final assignment. I did not know much about TailwindCSS but I saw a lot of people praise it so I decided to give it a try this time. After using it, I can say that it deserves all the compliments. Personally, I much prefer it to Bootstrap. TailwindCSS is just much more customizable and easy to use.

- Sass: I used Sass because I like that it has some interesting features that CSS does not have, for example variables. However, I did not use Sass to its full potential in this assignment because TailwindCSS alone already worked so well. Of course, I also used flexbox and grid a lot; I cannot imagine building a website without flexbox and grid ðŸ˜…

# General thoughts about the work process and what was learned

The process was quite smooth in general. I did not encounter any significant setbacks. I had a few difficulties making some components work as I wanted, for example images, SVG, but I solved those problems quite quickly after doing some research on the Internet. This was the first time I used TailwindCSS but thanks to its wonderful documentation, I got used to it in no time.

I learned so many things in this assignment:
- Initializing a Next.js + TailwindCSS + Sass web app with npm
- Using TailwindCSS
- Making scrolling and sliding animations for text
- Dealing with SVG and images
- Practicing responsive design, applying the mobile-first rule
- Some small things like outline text, customizable underline, etc.

# Grade proposal for yourself and reasons

I would expect a 5 as that was my goal and I tried to use all the best technologies in the assignment. I invested all my energy and my time into this because I wanted the highest grade. I am very satisfied with my work and I think the performance of the website is also superb.
